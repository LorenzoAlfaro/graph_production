## Introduction

If you are like me you are probably a very competitive person that 'enjoys' playing 1v1 _StarCraft 2_ 
(by 'enjoys' I mean enduring lots of frustration by resisting the urge to break your keyboard). 
If so, I pity your existence. There is nothing more frustrating than loosing games to opponents you consider inferior.

But to be true you are bias towards your performance during the match, especially when you are heated after loosing to a BattleCruiser rush. 
This tool will help you to be objetive and focus on the weakest areas of your gameplay.

Just 'macro' better! Worst advice ever.



## Current state

I know I made big promises on the introduction but currently the software does only thing. It creates graphs.

But there is a lot of insight hidden in graphs if you know how to read them. 

## Future state
I plan to extract metrics from the graphs (useful metrics, not like your APM). 
My vision, everytime a game is over, automatically give you a score on your main metrics. I've seen that the in-game graphs are decent but not as accurate. 
See comparison picture.
Also there is ggtracker that has very nice graphics but their metrics are not as useful.

## Interpreting the graphs

PICTURE.

Disclaimer, may main race in the game is Zerg. So there is a lot of bias towards improving gameplay as Zerg.

As you can see in this graph, from minutes 3-4 my drone production was flat. From 5-6 I'm building drones but at the same time I'm loosing drones because
I'm comsuming drones to morph into buildings.

Sometimes the enemy doesn't even have to kill your drones. You simply to forget to replaced them!

PICTURE 2.

Larva production. Something that is 50/50 controlled by the player. 50 percent of your larva is produced automatically. The other 50 comes from injects. If you don't use your larva, the
hatchery **stops** producing more. (1 larva every 10 seconds up to 3 larva)

So, in this graph you can follow how good you are using the larva as it is being produced. High larvae levels in the early game means you are not spending it! Big no no. 
After that you can find out why?
In my case I get distracted by the reaper. Or killing the opponents overlord. Either way, you are not doing what you are supposed to.
