# TODO 6 minutes metrics
# how many workers did I loose on the first 6 minutes
# how long does it take to the get 3 base saturation?
# how long to max out? 8:00 max roach metric
# what types of units kill my drones? adepts? reaper? liberator? hellions?

# creep tumor count
# overlord spread
# overseer changeling

# basic build opener of my oponent

# analize builds I loose to the most
# analize map records

# control group management - hard to analize
# analize my scouts - hard
# check location of enemy tech on the position of my units and vision? hard
# camera movements? how long does it take to respond to an attack or harrasment
# detect misclicks? hard

# make it run in the background
# save data in a database
# sort my replays and rename them
